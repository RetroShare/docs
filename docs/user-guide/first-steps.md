#First Steps

This aims to be a Step by Step Guide for New Users. 

##Download  
Download RetroShare from [here](../user-guide/installation/).

##Install
Install RetroShare on your Computer

##Create new Profile
Start RetroShare to create your Node. 

![create new node](../img/first-steps/create_new_profile_2.png "Create New Node")  


Enter the values:  

 - Name  
   Name of your Account ([GPG-ID](../user-guide/settings/#public-information)) 
   Visible to your friends, and friends of friends. 
 - Password  
   This password protects your private PGP key. 
   It's wise to choose a long password for your GPG-ID, as this also 
   encrypts your entire RetroShare directory.  
   Of course you want the password to be strong for the PGP, so we reccomend
   using one generated by password manager that also can store it efortlessly.
  
Optional: (advanced options)  
 - Node Name ([Location](../user-guide/settings/#public-information))
   Each user can have several Locations were RetroShare is running on 
   different devices with the same [GPG-ID](../user-guide/settings/#public-information). 

 - Chat name  
   Name of your first Identity ([GXS-ID](../user-guide/interface/#pseudonymous-identities)) 
   Used when you write in chat lobbies, forums and channel comments. Can be setup later if you need one. 

Move your mouse to create randomness for the Key creation. 

![Enter Profile Values](../img/first-steps/enter_profile_values_new.png "Enter Profile Values")  


Sign your Certificate by entering your Password.  
![Sign your Certificate](../img/first-steps/sign_cert.png "Sign your Certificate")  

##First Start  
When you start RetroShare the first time it's empty, because there is no 
content shared by friends. This will change soon with your first connected Friend. 

![First Start](../img/first-steps/first_start.png "First Start")  

##Initial Settings
Click on the ![Options](../img/first-steps/options.png "Options") Options 
Button to change your ![Network](../img/first-steps/network.png "Network") 
Network Settings  
![Initial Settings](../img/first-steps/initial_settings.png "Initial Settings")  


 - ![NAT Settings](../img/first-steps/nat_settings.png "NAT Settings")  
   Keep your Network Mode at *Public: DHT & Discovery*  
   This will enable DHT and Discovery to improve the connectivity. DHT is 
   also recommended to use, because it provides [Hole Punching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDP_hole_punching) 
   and [NAT-PMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAT_Port_Mapping_Protocol) 
   technics to open a port in your firewall. 
 - ![Network Mode](../img/first-steps/network_mode.png "Network Mode")  
   If your Router is enabling [UPnP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play), 
   keep UPnP. UPnP enables RetroShare to open itself a port on your Router. 
   Otherwise change it to *Manually Forwarded Port* and set a manual Port Forward to your 
   [NAT](../user-guide/settings/#nat) Firewall. For manual Port forward, 
   you can choose your RetroShare port also.  
 - Set your download and upload speeds to fit your Internet Connection. 
   Keeping this setting below of your total speed is recommended.

###Avatar

![empty Avatar](../img/first-steps/empty_avatar.png "Empty Avatar")  

You may want to change the Avatar of your Location and set a Status message.  

![Avatar](../img/first-steps/avatar.png "Avatar")  
<sub>Click on the avatar to change it.</sub>  

![Status](../img/first-steps/status.png "Status")  
<sub>Click on the message to change it.</sub>  

![avatar and status](../img/first-steps/avatar_status.png "Avatar and Status")  

###Identity
![People](../img/first-steps/people.png "People")  

RetroShare has already created a first [signed Identity](../user-guide/interface/#pseudonymous-identities) 
for your use in [Chatrooms](../user-guide/interface/#chat-lobbies) 
and [Forums](../user-guide/interface/#forums) and Distant Chats and Mails. 

You may want to create as many additional Identities as well if needed. 

![Identity](../img/first-steps/identity.png "signed Identity") 

To change the Avatar of your Identity right click it.  
![Edit Identity](../img/first-steps/edit_id.png "Edit Identity")  

![Edit Identity](../img/first-steps/edit_identity.png "Edit Identity")  

And change your avatar picture. 

![Edit Identity](../img/first-steps/id.png "Edit Identity")  


##First Friend
![Invite](../img/first-steps/invite.png "Invite")  

Click on the ![Invite](../img/first-steps/invite_40.png "Invite")   Invite Button. 

The fastest way is to exchange the certificates directly with your friends. 
You can also export them to a file and hand them out manually or send it by mail. 

It's important to accept each other vice versa. Your friend must add your 
certificate to his Network/Friendlist. And you need to add the certificate from 
your Friend to your Network/Friendlist.  
![Connect Wizard](../img/first-steps/connect_wizard.png "Connect Wizard")  

 - ![Copy to Clipborad](../img/first-steps/copyrslink.png "Copy to Clipboard") copy to clipboard  
 - ![Save to File](../img/first-steps/document_save.png "Save to File") save to file  
 - ![Send by Mail](../img/first-steps/mail_send.png "Send by Mail") send by mail  

![Show Certificate](../img/first-steps/show_cert.png "Show Certificate")  

Share your certificate with your friend and request the certificate from 
your Friend.  

Accept your Friend's certificate.  
![Accept Certificate](../img/first-steps/accept_cert.png "Accept Certificate")  


Have a look at the details and finish.  
![Make Friend](../img/first-steps/make_friend.png "Make Friend")  

Connection in Progress, your Node tries to connect to your Friend. 
![Connection in Progress](../img/first-steps/connection_progress.png "Connection in Progress")  

Your connect attempt has been successful, the connection is established. 
![Connection in Established](../img/first-steps/connection_established.png "Connection in Established")  


##First Chat
Your online Contacts(Friend Nodes) will be listed in the Network Tab. 
![Friendlist](../img/first-steps/friendlist.png "Friendlist")  

Double Clicking will start an instant Chat with your Friends. 
![Instant Chat](../img/first-steps/instant.png "Instant Chat")  

##First Chatroom
Subscribed [Chatrooms](../user-guide/interface/#chat-lobbies) 
from your online friends are shared to you, 
and you are free to subscribe and re-share them as well to your friends.  
![Chatroom](../img/first-steps/chatroom.png "Chatroom")  

In the same manner ![Forums](../img/first-steps/forums.png "Forums") [Forums](../user-guide/interface/#forums), 
![Channels](../img/first-steps/channels.png "Channels") [Channels](../user-guide/interface/#channels), 
![Posted](../img/first-steps/posted.png "Posted") [Posted](../user-guide/interface/#posted) and 
![File Sharing](../img/first-steps/filesharing.png "File Sharing") [File Sharing](../user-guide/interface/#file-sharing) 
will become more and more available per direct 
[Friend-2-Friend](../concept/Friend-2-Friend/#retroshare) 
connections as 
[**your network**](../concept/topology/#retroshare) grows.
